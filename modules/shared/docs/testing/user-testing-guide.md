   - Cross-browser compatibility

2. **Feature Effectiveness**
   - Point system motivation and engagement
   - Achievement system impact
   - Notification preferences and delivery
   - Family communication features

### Phase 4: Performance & Scale Testing ‚è≥
**Target Date**: After user feedback integration

#### 4.1 Performance Benchmarks
**Targets:**
- Page load time: <3s on 3G networks
- API response time: <200ms for standard operations
- Database query optimization: <100ms for complex queries
- Mobile app performance: 60fps smooth interactions

#### 4.2 Multi-Family Scale Testing
**Scenarios:**
- 10+ families concurrent usage
- 100+ users active simultaneously
- 1000+ tasks created and managed
- Real-time notification delivery at scale

## Testing Infrastructure

### Local Testing Setup
